A gpl'ed script called picmod.py which serves to resize (I've only a need for 
shrinkage) and rotate jpeg image files.

This is now (as of Jan 31, 2010) a functioning rewrite of a previous 
project I initially called picproc.py for picture processor written in Python.
The current name is for picture modifier in Python.

Since it is now working, I'll give this a version number:  v0.1
This number reflects the fact that I'm sure there are still a lot of bugs
and the fact that there's more I want to add.

The rewrite was done to eliminate the need for globals by using an instance of 
a class; (an idea suggested by Dan Silverstein who runs an informal weekly
Python tutorial at NoiseBridge in San Francisco)
what used to be globals have become attributes of that instance.
These attributes are populated in a way that reflects the options chosen by
the user on the command line. There are also other attributes that are 
set and used by the processing machine.

Still not implemented but something I very much want to add is the optional
creation of an html file containing links to the generated image files. 
Apart from the obvious worth of being able to look at the photos using a 
browser, this would have the added benefit of doing much of the work if one
wanted to use these photos in a web page: the link syntax would already
be there.

Enjoy!
